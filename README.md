# Objective

>The objective of this project was to learn a Stack widely used in the market (Node + React + ReactNative). This learning was carried out with great enthusiasm on my part because I was excited about the possibilities of it. Being in the future to evolve the application by placing an API for Portugal (Country where I live) and placing it on the market to help people find places where they can put their unusual waste such as batteries, oil etc.
